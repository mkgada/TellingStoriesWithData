# Mihir Gada- TellingStoriesWithData
This is a public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class. It will serve to be a treasure trove of all the work that we will accomplish in this class.

# About me
I am a second year Masters of Information Systems Management student at Heinz. I completed my first two semesters at the Adelaide campus of CMU in Australia, interned at Cochlear in Sydney and finally managed to come to Pittsburgh to finish up my Masters this Fall.

# What I would love to learn from this class
I am strong believer in the visual representation of numbers/text. It is an acquired skill and I would love to master it. I believe that your results are as good as you convey them and thus representation stands to be one of the toughest skills.

Here is where all my visualizations will go!
