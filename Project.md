# Data
For this project, the primary data source is public dataset "Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data" available on data.gov.in.
Data.gov.in is the open government data portal for India. It is used by the Government of India to make available datasets, documents, reports, surveys gathered by them to the general masses of India.

Historical Ambient Air Quality Data is collected on the a daily basis by the Ministry of Environment and Forests along with the Central Pollution Control Board. This daily data is available for the years 1987 onwards uptill 2015. Since the data is collected on a daily basis for a particular year, I have proceeded to calculate the average Air Quality for a particular year and use it for a time-series analysis.
