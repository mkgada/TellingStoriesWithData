# Project Part 2

<h2>Progress after Part 1</h2>
Part 1 of the final project involved identifying the cause I wanted to address and a particular call to action to help alleviate that problem. It also involved sourcing the appropriate data to support my argument and use effective visualizations to convey the underlying message.

In Part 2, I have proceeded with actually creating a digital storyboard to bring the opportunity to real life and collected user feedback by medium of interviews with 3 anonymous users and further refining my storyboard in accordance with their feedback.

Here is my initial take on the sketches developed as a part of Part 1 of the Project

The actual file consisting of the interview feedback is attached below.
[User Feedback](/User%20Feedback.xlsx)

The interviews consisted of asking users specific questions related to the digital storyboard created like:

- What do you think is the intended audience for this story?
- Is there logical flow in the storyboard created? 
- What elements of the story stand out for you?
- What elements of the story are not helpful?
- Are the data visualizations helpful? Are they in congruence with the underlying message to convey?
And so on...


Key Takeaways from User Feedback:
- The storyline does not have smooth transitions from one section to another. There are abrupt breaks between sections
- The blue background of the textual content is misleading 
- The visualizations are apt and convey the message but they need to refined further

Changes in Iteration 2:
- Defined clear section breaks in the form of pages
- Eliminated the blue background and converted it to transparent background
- Fixed the flow of the storyboard and also the left-right formatting
- Used powerful imagery as background to set the tone of the corressponding section
