<h1>New Delhi: Capital of India? Or Toxic gas chamber?</h1>
This project is aimed to address the aggravating air pollution issue in New Delhi, India. It is a data-driven walk through the potential causes of the problem, effects of bad air quality and finally a potential policy change as a call-to-action.

The project has been developed following an iterative process of making artifacts, collecting user feedback and making improvement till the delivery of the final project. 

<h2>Part 1: Project Proposal</h2>

<h3>Outline</h3>
<h4> Summary </h4>
For this project, I have chosen to address the issue of depreciating Air Quality in New Delhi, the capital of India. It is going to look at the history of air quality index in the city and the possible causes that has led to this issue. 

<h4>Approach</h4>

- Historic Significance of New Delhi
- Growth of population 
- Growth of vehicular traffic
- Top contributors to bad air quality
- Effects of bad air quality
- Proposed Policy change

<h4> Call to Action </h4>
Propose a potential change in policy to local government looking at the possible causes of the adverse air quality in New Delhi.

<h3>Data</h3>
For this project, the primary data source is public dataset "Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data" available on data.gov.in.
Data.gov.in is the open government data portal for India. It is used by the Government of India to make available datasets, documents, reports, surveys gathered by them to the general masses of India.

Historical Ambient Air Quality Data is collected on the a daily basis by the Ministry of Environment and Forests along with the Central Pollution Control Board. This daily data is available for the years 1987 onwards uptill 2015. Since the data is collected on a daily basis for a particular year, I have proceeded to calculate the average Air Quality for a particular year and use it for a time-series analysis.

I am also going to use population data of New Delhi from http://statisticstimes.com/demographics/population-of-delhi.php to obtain the growth in population of New Delhi over the time period in consideration

Apart from this, I am also going to use the data about the number of vehicles registered provided by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Note that this dataset is state-wise data and we would focus on state of Delhi for the project. The link to the website is as follows: http://mospi.nic.in/statistical-year-book-india/2018/189
