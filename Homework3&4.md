# Homework 3 and 4

# Choice of Data Visualization and Reason
I have chosen the "Save Success Rate (% of Shots saved Target faced)" visualization published in an article by The Guardian.
It talks about the surprising performance decline of Europe's top goalkeepers in the 2018/19 season compared to 2017/18. 
Here is the link to the article: https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2018/nov/29/europe-top-de-gea-courtois-ter-stegen-neuer

[Save Success Rate (% of Shots saved Target faced)](/HW4_4.png)

The reasons for choosing this visualization are:
- I am an avid football(soccer) lover and used to play the sport professionally in high-school.
- I follow all kinds of footballing action that happens in Europe and am updated about the performance levels of most top players in various teams
- Sometimes, I might be not aware of the correct information and thus I research about the statistics online to be up-to-date. I came across this article published by Guardian talking about goalkeeper's performance. I looked at it and was mislead with the arrangement of the bars that overlapped and a couple of other factors led me to choose this visualization.
