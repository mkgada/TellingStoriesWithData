# Homework 3 and 4

# Choice of Data Visualization and Reason
I have chosen the "Save Success Rate (% of Shots saved Target faced)" visualization published in an article by The Guardian.
It talks about the surprising performance decline of Europe's top goalkeepers in the 2018/19 season compared to 2017/18. 
Here is the link to the article: https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2018/nov/29/europe-top-de-gea-courtois-ter-stegen-neuer

The reasons for choosing this visualization are:
- I am an avid football(soccer) lover and used to play the sport professionally in high-school.
- I follow all kinds of footballing action that happens in Europe and am updated about the performance levels of most top players in various teams
- Sometimes, I might be not aware of the correct information and thus I research about the statistics online to be up-to-date. I came across this article published by Guardian talking about goalkeeper's performance. I looked at it and was mislead with the arrangement of the bars that overlapped and a couple of other factors led me to choose this visualization.

# Intended Target Audience
The target audience for this piece of information fall into the following broader categories:
- Football followers (people like me)
- Football pundits (who analyse players and teams and talk about it on sports shows)
- Team Scouts (Each team has a scout who looks for potential players who would fit better in their team)

# First observations and possible recommendations
A bar graph is used to show a year on year comparison of % of shots saved by a goal keeper. Also, it aims to point out that top keepers from 2017/18 season such as David De Gea, Courtois, Neuer, Marc Andre ter Stegen have struggled in the 2018/19.
The things that stood for me are:
-	Data represents 2017/18 season and 2018/19 season. The manner in which they have been represented is misleading. For example, the 2018/19 season statistics have been shown with green bars and 2018/19 season statistics have been shown in semi-transparent color. Both the bars have been overlapped on top of each other for each goalkeeper.
-	The scale of the % shots saved on the y-axis has been truncated. It starts from 45%
-	This is misleading because the 2017/18 statistics in the semi-transparent bars have been shown on the right hand side for each goal keeper where the 2018/19 season statistics are on the left. Human read from left-to-right which and this arrangement would mislead them to think that the left bar in green in 2017/18 season and the transparent one is for 2018/19 season.
-	Further, the chart required a significant amount of eye travel to fully understand that for top goalkeepers, their % shots saved has decreased from the previous year for the top keepers from 2017/18. However, with the previous year bar appearing on the right-hand side of the chart for each keeper, it appears as if there is an increase in the % of shot saved year-on-year.


The things I would do differently are as follows:
-	Firstly, I would arrange the bar chart in such as way such that the 2017/18 statistics appear side by side to the 2018/19 statistics and not overlapping. Also, 2017/18 on the left and other on the right for each goal keeper
-	To highlight the dip in performance for the top keepers in 2017/18, I would proceed by arranging them in such a way in the chart such that the top keepers from previous years appear before the top keepers in 2018/19 season
-	The scale of the chart has been truncated and starts at 45% on the y-axis. I would proceed to start the scale from 0% on the y-axis
-	For all keepers with statistics from 2017/18 as well as 2018/19, I would proceed with graying the bar with the lower performance out of the two seasons. For example, David De Gea’s has lower performance in 2018/19, so that would be grayed but Buffon’s performance has increased in 2018/19 and the lower out of the two values is of 2017/18, so for Buffon that would be gray. Basically, the better performance years from the two would be in green and lower performance in gray to highlight the change
